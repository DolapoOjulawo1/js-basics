Question 1: What runs JavaScript outside the browser ?
Answer: Node.js allows JavaScript to be run outside the browser

Question 2: Name 5 things JavaScript can do ?
Answer: a. Build full blown Web or Mobile Applications.
        b. Build Real-time Networking Applications like Chats, Video Streaming Services, Command line tools or even games.
        c. JavaScript is also used for Front-end development. Front-end developers use CSS, HTML and JavaScripts to create
           the visible parts of a website or web application. JavaScript Frameworks like Angular, Vue and React make it easier for developers to use JavaScript to create Front-end web apps which allows them to structure their client-side applications with support for 
           client-side routing so that users can navigate between different pages without having to refresh the entire page's content.
        d. JavaScript is used for Data Visualization or creating visual representations of data using code. For example, many people use D3.js
           to create interactive graphs, charts and maps that update in real-time based on revised data sets.
        e. Companies even use JavaScript to build third-party plugins for their products, like Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Office. These 
           plugins are written in JavaScript source code and allow developers to add new features (and even create entire applications within certain applications like Adobe Photoshop).

Question 3: When was ECMAScript first released ?
Answer: The first version of ECMAScript was first released in June 1997.

Question 4: How do you log to console ?
Answer:  a. Open up Chrome
         b. Right click on empty area and go to inspect
         c. This opens up Chrome developer tools. Hence, select the console tab

Question 5: List the tech fields that use JavaScript for example FrontEnd 
Answer:  a. Front End Web Developer 
         b. Web Application Developer
         c. JavaScript Developer
         d. UX Designer
         e. Web Designer
         f. UI Designer
         g. Full Stack Designer
         h. DevOps Engineer

Question 6: Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed Programming Languages and give examples of language that fall under 
            each category

Answer:     A programming language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time.
            A language is dynamically typed if the type of a variable is checked during run-time.            

                                            Statically-Typed Programming Languages
            We call a language “statically-typed” if it follows type checking during compilation. So, every detail about the variables and all the data types must be known before we do the compiling process.
            In this type of language, once a variable is assigned a type, it can’t be assigned to some other variable of a different type. If we try to do so, the compiler will raise some errors, and we need to fix them. Hence, for a declared variable, the data type is fixed.
            Some examples of statically-typed languages are Java, C, C++, C#, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Pascal, Rust, Go, COBOL, etc.
            If you have experience in using these programming languages, you might know what I’m saying. It is common to get some type-errors while working with these languages.
            In most of the statically-typed languages, the programmer must specify what the data type of each variable is, just like we do in Java, C, and C++.
            But for some other languages like Hascall, Scala, and Kotlin, the type system have the in-built capability (which is called type inference) to deduce the type of a variable from the code.
            Now, take a look at an example to see how a variable is declared in the C language.
            int mangoes = 10;
            In this example, we defined a variable name called ‘mangoes’ and specified the type as int (integer value). And, we gave it a value of 10.
            This is how we declare a variable in a statically-typed language like C. In this case, the compiler can directly identify that the type of the variable is int.
            One great thing about statically-typed languages is that we’ll be able to fix a lot of errors even before running the program. Once we successfully compile the program, we don’t need to worry about any kinds of syntax errors. The code will be ready to be executed.
           Now the code is almost done, and the compiler knows what each data type is. Hence, it can produce an optimized machine code that uses less memory. So, the execution of the code will be faster compared to the dynamically-typed languages. These are the main advantages of statically-typed languages.
         

                                                Dynamically-typed Programming Languages
           We call a language “dynamically typed” if type checking takes place while the program runs (run-time). In this type of language, there is no need to specify the data type of each variable while writing code.
           It means that you can write pretty quickly since you do not have to specify types every time. Some languages do allow you to provide type information but do not require it.
           Most modern programming languages are dynamically typed. Some examples of dynamically-typed languages are Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, R, Dart, Lua, Objective-C, etc.
           A dynamically-typed language has the capability to identify the type of each variable during run-time. In these languages, variables are bound to objects at run-time using assignment statements.
           We do not need to declare the data types of variables before we use them. Let’s see an example using Python.
           mangoes = 10 
           Scripting languages are mostly dynamic, as there is no compiler to do static type-checking. However, there are chances where you may find yourself searching for a bug that is due to the interpreter misinterpreting the type of a variable. Fortunately, scripts tend to be tiny, and hence bugs do not have so many rooms to hide.
           One advantage of dynamically-typed languages is that it is easy to write code without worrying about the type of variables. The lack of a separate compilation step implies that programmers don’t have to wait for the compiler to finish before they can test the changes in code.
           The dynamic objects are having some run-time type-information(RTTI). It can be helpful to implement some pretty cool features like dynamic dispatch, down-casting, late binding, reflection, etc.
           Statically typed languages have better performance at run-time and are faster at run-time. It is because there is no need for type checking at run-time, and the code has already been translated.
           But dynamically-typed languages are comparatively faster during development time and are more flexible.


Question 7: Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined&nbsp
                    UNDEFINED JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPE
             a. In JavaScript, undefined is a type. 
             b. It means a variable declared, but no value has been assigned a value.
             c. The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been declared at all.
             d. It is an ECMAScript1 (ES1) feature.
             e. Its supported browsers are -: Chrome , Microsoft Edge , Internet Explorer , Firefox , Safari , Opera Mini
             f. It is a global property.

                    For example,
                    var demo;
                    alert(demo); //shows undefined
                    alert(typeof demo); //shows undefined

                     NULL JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPE
             a. In JavaScript, null an object. it's an assignment value. 
             b. You can assign it to a variable. It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.
             c. The value null represents the absence of any object value.
             d. It is Primitive value in Javascript.
             e. Its syntax is -: null
             f.Its supported browsers are -: Chrome , Microsoft Edge , Internet Explorer , Firefox , Safari , Opera Mini

                     For example,
                     var demo = null;
                     alert(demo); //shows null
                     alert(typeof demo); //shows object

Question 8: In the ‘js-basics’ folder you created above, create a file and name it ‘index.js’. Inside the 
            file, Write a function that multiplies two numbers. Call that function to multiply any  two numbers of your choice and log the answer in your console
